  <p>Very few people actually know how the ethernet came to birth. Viewed by some modern generation as a little outdated the ethernet is one of the reasons why we're connected in this age. All this is thanks to the man above who co-invented this technology.</p>
  <p> Here's a timeline of his life/work.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>1946:</b> Born in Broklyn New york</li>

  <p>Outside of his technical achievements, Metcalfe is perhaps best known for his 1995 prediction that the Internet would suffer a "catastrophic collapse" the following year; he promised to eat his words if it did not. During his keynote speech at the sixth International World Wide Web Conference in 1997, he took a printed copy of his column that predicted the collapse, put it in a blender with some liquid and then consumed the pulpy mass. This was after he tried to eat his words in the form of a very large cake, but the audience strongly protested.</p>
